The Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus (SDCA; https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/) is hiring
a team to work on a recently funded software and data project. This project
aims to build an open and scalable infrastructure Framework for working with,
discovering, and managing data that follows FAIR and open science principles.
A full description of the Framework project can be found at 
https://steno-aarhus.github.io/dif-project/.

SDCA is a center that brings together researchers and clinicians in an aim to
better integrate work on multiple aspects of diabetes treatment, research, and
education. The Framework project will be largely contributing to the research of
the center (https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/research/) as well as that of other
research centers and initiatives throughout Denmark.

Since SDCA was started only a few years ago, its technical and social
infrastructure are still being actively developed. As a result, all SDCA
personnel, including this current job along with the Framework team, have a
direct and impactful influence on how the culture and infrastructure is built
and developed. Aside from working on the Framework, other responsibilities for
this current job position, as well as the rest of the team, include contributing
to this (explicit and inclusive) culture, for instance by adding to our Common
Docs (https://steno-aarhus.github.io/research/).
